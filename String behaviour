#Immutable objects:
#integer, float, string, tuple, bool, frozenset
#An immutable object is an object that is not changeable and its state cannot be modified after it is created.
#In Python, a string is immutable. You cannot overwrite the values of immutable objects.
#However, you can assign the variable again.
test='chekking objects'
id(test)
#1236701164144
test='changed values'
id(test)
#-1236701132080
# as string is an immutable object we can't alter its value but a new value can be assigned 
# so in this case variable will be allocated to a new memory location.
# case2 when we assign sam value to another variable to check if address is same of changed
test2='chekking objects'
id(test2)
#1236700565984
# address got changed means a new object will be created
