#Immutable objects:
#integer, float, string, tuple, bool, frozenset
#An immutable object is an object that is not changeable and its state cannot be modified after it is created.
#In Python, a string is immutable. You cannot overwrite the values of immutable objects.
#However, you can assign the variable again.

test='chekking objects'
id(test)
#1236701164144

test='changed values'
id(test)
#-1236701132080

# as string is an immutable object we can't alter its value but a new value can be assigned 
# so in this case variable will be allocated to a new memory location.
# case2 when we assign same value to another variable to check if address is same of changed

test2='chekking objects'
id(test2)
#1236700565984

# address got changed means a new object will be created

test='abcdef'
test[::-1]
# 'fedcba'

# trick to reverese the whole string
# the last parameter is the increment to fetch the ith element
# if is positive then count starts from 0 otherwie at the end. as shown below

test[::-3]
#'fc'

test[::2]
# 'ace'

test[0:3:]
'abc'

#[::]- first parameter indicates to start from which position
#second paramter indicates upto which position (+ start from left, - starts from right)
#third parameter indicates the increment or decrement
keep blank and index will be start

•	split() – uses a regex pattern to “split” a given string into a list.
•	sub() – finds all substrings where the regex pattern matches and then replace them with a different string
•	subn() – it is similar to sub() and also returns the new string along with the no. of replacements.
